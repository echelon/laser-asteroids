Laser Asteroids
===============
Programmed for 2012 [Georgia Game Jam](http://www.spsu.edu/games/gamejam/), 
Laser Asteroids utilizes the [Ether Dream](http://www.ether-dream.com/) 
DAC for laser projectors to project a game inspired by *Asteroids* onto a
surface of choice. 

This game was developed on a 30Kpps Laser Projector, and I'm anxious to see
if it runs on any other setups. 

Libraries, etc. 
---------------
Laser Asteroids leverages the `PyGame framework` to capture input from 
videogame controllers. It was initially tested with a PS3 controller, but
development has continued with an XBox 360 controller. You may need to adjust
the bindings if you wish to run the code.

This project contain's Jacob Potter's GPL-licensed `dac.py`, which is also
[available on github](https://github.com/j4cbo/j4cDAC).
